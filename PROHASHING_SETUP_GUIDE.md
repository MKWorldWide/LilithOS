# 🔐 ProHashing Setup Guide - Scrypt Mining Framework

## 🎯 **Quick Start with ProHashing**

The Scrypt Mining Framework is now configured to work seamlessly with ProHashing pool using your provided settings.

### 📋 **Your ProHashing Configuration**
```
Connection URL: stratum+tcp://us.mining.prohashing.com:3333
Username: EsKaye
Password: a=scrypt
Algorithm: Scrypt
```

### 🚀 **Start Mining in 3 Steps**

#### **Step 1: Start the Framework**
```bash
npm run start-mining
```

#### **Step 2: Open the Mining Interface**
- Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
- Go to "Mining Operations" page

#### **Step 3: Configure and Start Mining**
1. Click "Start Mining" button
2. Select "ProHashing Pool" from the pool dropdown
3. Enter your ProHashing username: `EsKaye`
4. Set your preferred number of CPU threads (4-8 recommended)
5. Click "Start Mining"

### ⚙️ **Advanced Configuration**

#### **Environment Variables (Optional)**
If you want to customize the configuration, edit `backend/.env`:

```bash
# ProHashing Configuration
PROHASHING_POOL_URL=stratum+tcp://us.mining.prohashing.com:3333
PROHASHING_USERNAME=EsKaye
PROHASHING_PASSWORD=a=scrypt

# Mining Parameters
DEFAULT_THREADS=4
DEFAULT_INTENSITY=8
```

#### **Mining Parameters**
- **Threads**: Number of CPU cores to use (1-16)
- **Intensity**: Mining intensity level (1-20)
  - 1-5: Low intensity (good for multitasking)
  - 6-12: Medium intensity (balanced)
  - 13-20: High intensity (maximum performance)

### 📊 **Monitoring Your Mining**

#### **Real-time Statistics**
- **Hash Rate**: Current mining speed in MH/s
- **Shares**: Accepted and rejected shares
- **Uptime**: How long mining has been running
- **Status**: Running/Stopped/Error indicators

#### **ProHashing Dashboard**
- Visit: https://prohashing.com
- Login with your credentials
- Monitor your mining progress and earnings

### 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

#### **Common Issues**

**1. Connection Failed**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the pool URL is correct
- Ensure firewall allows outbound connections on port 3333

**2. Low Hash Rate**
- Increase the number of threads
- Reduce system load (close other applications)
- Check CPU temperature and throttling

**3. High Rejected Shares**
- Reduce mining intensity
- Check for network latency issues
- Verify pool configuration

#### **Performance Optimization**

**For Best Performance:**
```bash
# High-performance settings
Threads: 8 (or number of CPU cores)
Intensity: 12-15
```

**For Background Mining:**
```bash
# Conservative settings
Threads: 4
Intensity: 6-8
```
