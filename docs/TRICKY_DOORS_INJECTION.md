## 🔧 **Installation Guide**

### Prerequisites
- Nintendo Switch with custom firmware (Atmosphere recommended)
- RCM payload injector
- SD card with sufficient space
- Tricky Doors application installed

### Step 1: Prepare SD Card
```powershell
# Run the payload injection setup script
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/tricky_doors_payload_injector.ps1 -Drive O: -Force
```

### Step 2: Install on Switch
1. Insert SD card into Nintendo Switch
2. Boot into RCM mode (jig or paperclip method)
3. Inject Atmosphere payload
4. Navigate to Homebrew Menu
5. Launch LilithOS Injection Launcher

### Step 3: Activate Injection
1. Select "Hardware Bypass" from the launcher
2. Choose target application (Tricky Doors)
3. Confirm injection parameters
4. Execute payload injection

## 🎯 **Payload Types**

### 1. Hardware Bypass Payload
**Purpose**: Override hardware lock checks in applications

**Features**:
- Bypass hardware verification routines
- Override memory protection checks
- Force unlock restricted features
- Modify system call behavior

**Target Functions**:
```assembly
# Original hardware check
mov rax, [hardware_status]
cmp rax, 0x1
jne lock_failed

# Patched version (always succeeds)
mov rax, 0x1
ret
```

### 2. Custom Injection Payload
**Purpose**: Inject custom code into running applications

**Features**:
- Dynamic code injection
- Runtime modification
- Custom function hooks
- Memory manipulation

**Injection Points**:
- Application startup
- Function entry points
- System call intercepts
- Memory allocation hooks

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### IPS Patch Format
The hardware bypass uses IPS (International Patching System) format for binary patches:

```
PATCH
# Patch header
# Offset: 0x12345678
# Original bytes: 48 89 5C 24 08 48 89 74 24 10
# Patched bytes: C3 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90 90
EOF
```

### Memory Layout
```

├── Magic: "LILITHOS"
├── Version: 2.0.0
├── Type: Hardware Bypass
└── Checksum: 0x12345678

0x0010: Code Section (256 bytes)

```

### Atmosphere Integration
The system integrates with Atmosphere custom firmware through:

1. **ExeFS Patches**: Binary patches applied to executable files
2. **Title Override**: Application-specific configuration
3. **System Settings**: Global injection parameters
4. **Payload Loading**: Dynamic payload injection

## 🛠️ **Configuration Options**

### Hardware Bypass Settings
```ini
[hardware_bypass]
enabled = 1
target_title_id = 0100000000000000
patch_type = exefs
patch_file = hardware_bypass.ips

bypass_hardware_checks = 1
bypass_memory_protection = 1
bypass_security_checks = 1
force_unlock = 1

inject_custom_code = 1
override_system_calls = 1
modify_game_logic = 1
```

### Injection Parameters
```ini
[injection_config]
payload_type = hardware_bypass
target_application = tricky_doors
injection_method = exefs_patch

# Advanced settings
debug_mode = 1
verbose_logging = 1
safety_checks = 1
rollback_enabled = 1
```

## 🔒 **Security Considerations**

### Safety Features
- **Validation Checks**: Verify payload integrity before injection
- **Rollback Capability**: Restore original state if needed
- **Debug Mode**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- **Safety Checks**: Prevent dangerous modifications

### Risk Mitigation
- **Backup Creation**: Automatic backup of original files
- **Validation**: Checksum verification of all modifications
- **Isolation**: Sandboxed execution environment
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system state monitoring

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Payload injection fails
**Solution**: 
1. Verify Atmosphere is properly installed
2. Check payload file integrity
3. Ensure sufficient memory space
4. Review debug logs

**Issue**: Hardware locks not bypassed
**Solution**:
1. Verify target application is correct
2. Check patch offsets are valid
3. Ensure payload is properly loaded
4. Review configuration settings

**Issue**: System instability
**Solution**:
1. Disable injection temporarily
2. Check for conflicting patches
3. Review system logs
4. Restore from backup if needed

### Debug Information
Enable debug mode for detailed logging:
```ini
[debug]
enabled = 1
log_level = verbose
log_file = /switch/lilithos_app/debug.log
```

## 📚 **Advanced Usage**

### Custom Payload Development
1. **Analyze Target**: Reverse engineer target application
2. **Identify Points**: Find hardware check locations
3. **Create Patch**: Develop custom IPS patch
4. **Test Validation**: Verify patch effectiveness
5. **Deploy**: Install and activate payload

### Integration with Other Tools
