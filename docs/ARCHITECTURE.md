# LilithOS Architecture

## System Overview
LilithOS is built on a modified Kali Linux base, with custom optimizations for Mac Pro 2009 hardware. The system architecture is designed to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience while maintaining compatibility with both Linux and macOS environments.

## Core Components

### 1. Boot System
- Custom EFI bootloader based on GRUB2
- Secure boot support
- Dual boot configuration manager
- Recovery partition support

### 2. Kernel
- Custom Linux kernel (based on Kali's kernel)
- Mac Pro 2009 hardware optimizations
- Enhanced security features
- Custom drivers for Apple hardware

### 3. Package Management
- APT-based package system
- Custom repository for LilithOS-specific packages
- Security updates integration
- Package signing and verification

### 4. Security Layer
- Enhanced security features from Kali Linux
- Custom security policies
- Hardware-based security features
- Secure boot implementation

### 5. Desktop Environment
- Custom desktop environment
- Hardware-accelerated graphics
- Touchpad and keyboard optimizations
- Display management

## System Integration

### Hardware Support
- CPU: Intel Xeon processors
- GPU: ATI Radeon HD 4870/5770/5870
- Storage: SATA and PCIe SSDs
- Network: Broadcom and Intel NICs
- Audio: Apple custom audio hardware

### Software Stack
- Base: Debian/Kali Linux
- Desktop: Custom environment
- Security: Kali Linux tools
- Development: Full development toolchain

## Boot Process
1. EFI firmware initialization
2. GRUB2 bootloader
3. Kernel loading with custom parameters
4. Initial RAM disk (initrd)
5. System initialization
6. Desktop environment startup

## Security Architecture
- Secure boot implementation
- Full disk encryption support
- Secure package management
- System integrity verification
- Hardware security features

## Development Guidelines
- Follow Debian packaging guidelines
- Maintain security-first approach
- Document all custom modifications
