# AI-Powered Assistant ("LilithAI")

> **On-device AI assistant for LilithOS automation and management**

---

## üí° Feature Overview
LilithAI is an on-device AI assistant that provides natural language commands, automation, troubleshooting, system health checks, and contextual help for LilithOS. It processes all data locally for maximum privacy and security.

## üß† Detailed Implementation
- **Module Loader:** `init.sh` initializes AI directories and model storage.
- **CLI Interface:** Command-line AI assistant with natural language processing.
- **GUI Widget:** Desktop widget for quick AI interactions.
- **Automation Engine:** Script generation and task automation.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dependency Mapping
- Python 3.8+
- AI/ML libraries (TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Natural language processing tools
- GPU acceleration (optional)
- Cloud AI services (optional)

## üß© Usage Examples
```sh
# Initialize LilithAI
source modules/features/lilith-ai/init.sh
lilith_ai_init

# Start CLI assistant (future)
modules/features/lilith-ai/cli/assistant.sh

# Ask for help (future)
lilith-ai "How do I install a new module?"

# Generate script (future)
lilith-ai "Create a script to backup my system"
```

## ‚ö° Performance Metrics
- Fast response times (<2 seconds)
- Optimized for on-device processing
- Configurable model sizes

## üîí Security Considerations
- All processing done locally
- No data sent to external services
- Secure command execution with validation
- Privacy-first design
