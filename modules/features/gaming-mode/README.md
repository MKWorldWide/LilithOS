- **Joy-Con Support:** Advanced integration with motion controls, rumble, and IR camera.
- **Gaming Overlay:** In-game overlay for system monitoring and controls.
- **Performance Optimization:** Low-latency mode and gaming-specific optimizations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dependency Mapping
- Controller drivers (Xbox, PlayStation, Joy-Con)
- Gaming optimization tools
- Joy-Con specific drivers (optional)
- Overlay framework (optional)

## üß© Usage Examples
```sh
# Initialize gaming mode
source modules/features/gaming-mode/init.sh
gaming_mode_init
