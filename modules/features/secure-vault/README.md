# Quantum Secure Vault

> **Encrypted secrets and credential storage for LilithOS**

---

## 💡 Feature Overview
Quantum Secure Vault provides a highly secure, encrypted storage solution for secrets, credentials, and sensitive files within LilithOS. It supports both CLI and GUI access, with future support for biometric unlock and hardware-backed keys.

## 🧠 Detailed Implementation
- **Module Loader:** `init.sh` initializes the vault and sets up the secure storage directory.
- **CLI Interface:** `vault.sh` allows storing, retrieving, listing, and deleting secrets using AES-256 encryption.
- **GUI:** (Planned) User-friendly interface for managing secrets.
- **Audit Logging:** All access is logged for security and compliance.

## 🗂️ Dependency Mapping
- `openssl` (encryption)
- `bash` (scripting)
- (Planned) Biometric/hardware key support

## 🧩 Usage Examples
```sh
# Initialize the vault
source modules/features/secure-vault/init.sh
quantum_vault_init

# Store a secret
modules/features/secure-vault/vault.sh store github_token "ghp_abc123..."

# Retrieve a secret
modules/features/secure-vault/vault.sh get github_token

# List all secrets
modules/features/secure-vault/vault.sh list

# Delete a secret
modules/features/secure-vault/vault.sh delete github_token
```

## ⚡ Performance Metrics
- Fast for small secrets (<1KB)
- Scales to large files, but encryption is CPU-bound

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- AES-256 encryption for all secrets
- Access is logged in `vault.log`
- (Planned) Biometric unlock, hardware-backed keys
