# Quantum Secure Vault Module Loader
# ----------------------------------
# ðŸ“‹ Quantum Documentation:
#   This script initializes the Quantum Secure Vault feature module for LilithOS.
#   It provides encrypted storage for secrets, credentials, and sensitive files.
#   The module can be loaded dynamically by the module manager or invoked directly.
#
# ðŸ§© Feature Context:
#   - Part of the modular security suite for LilithOS.
#   - Integrates with the system for secure storage and retrieval.
#   - CLI and GUI interfaces available.
#
# ðŸ§· Dependency Listings:
#   - Requires: openssl, bash, file system access
#   - Optional: biometric unlock (future), hardware-backed keys
#
# ðŸ’¡ Usage Example:
#   source modules/features/secure-vault/init.sh
#   quantum_vault_init
#
# âš¡ Performance Considerations:
#   - Uses strong encryption, may be CPU intensive for large files.
#
# ðŸ”’ Security Implications:
#   - All secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit.
#   - Access is logged and can be audited.
#
# ðŸ“œ Changelog Entries:
#   - 2024-06-29: Initial module loader created.
