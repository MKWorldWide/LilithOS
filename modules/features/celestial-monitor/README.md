# Advanced System Monitor ("Celestial Monitor")

> **Real-time resource monitoring with beautiful glass UI**

---

## üí° Feature Overview
Celestial Monitor provides real-time system resource monitoring with a beautiful glass aesthetic UI. It tracks CPU, RAM, GPU, disk, network, temperature, and process tree, with both menu bar widget and full window interfaces.

## üß† Detailed Implementation
- **Module Loader:** `init.sh` initializes monitoring directories and environment.
- **GUI Interface:** (Planned) Beautiful glass UI with real-time graphs.
- **Menu Bar Widget:** (Planned) Compact system overview in menu bar.
- **Metrics Collection:** Efficient data gathering with configurable intervals.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dependency Mapping
- System monitoring tools (top, iostat, etc.)
- GUI framework (future implementation)
- GPU monitoring tools (optional)
- Temperature sensors (optional)

## üß© Usage Examples
```sh
# Initialize the monitor
source modules/features/celestial-monitor/init.sh
celestial_monitor_init

# Launch the GUI (future)
modules/features/celestial-monitor/gui/launch.sh

# Start menu bar widget (future)
modules/features/celestial-monitor/widgets/menu-bar.sh
```

## ‚ö° Performance Metrics
- Low overhead monitoring (<1% CPU)
- Configurable update intervals (1s-60s)
- Efficient data visualization

## üîí Security Considerations
- Read-only access to system metrics
- No sensitive data collection
- Local-only operation
