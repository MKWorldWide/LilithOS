# Wine Manager for Windows .exe Files
# -----------------------------------
# ðŸ“‹ Quantum Documentation:
#   This script manages Wine environments for running Windows .exe files
#   in LilithOS. It handles Wine installation, configuration, and execution
#   of Windows applications with proper sandboxing and performance optimization.
#
# ðŸ§© Feature Context:
#   - Wine environment management and configuration.
#   - Windows .exe file execution and compatibility.
#   - Application sandboxing and isolation.
#   - Performance optimization and caching.
#
# ðŸ§· Dependency Listings:
#   - Requires: Wine, winetricks, cabextract
#   - Optional: PlayOnLinux, CrossOver, additional Windows libraries
#
# ðŸ’¡ Usage Examples:
#   ./wine-manager.sh install-wine
#   ./wine-manager.sh run-app "path/to/app.exe"
#   ./wine-manager.sh configure-wine
#
# âš¡ Performance Considerations:
#   - Wine virtualization overhead management.
#   - Application caching for faster startup.
#   - Memory and CPU optimization.
#
# ðŸ”’ Security Implications:
#   - Sandboxed Wine environments.
#   - Application isolation and permission management.
#   - Secure file handling and validation.
#
# ðŸ“œ Changelog Entries:
#   - 2024-06-29: Initial Wine manager created.
